Jeremy Freehill Portfolio Site
=========

Repository for my site. Anybody can view the source anyway, so why not make it easier?

hosted at: http://jeremy.freehill.me or http://jeremyfreehill.com

**Unrelated to this repo:** 
One of my top goals for this site, beyond presenting my portfolio in a usable manner, is page performance. I've
taken most possible measures to reach that goal and am pretty satisfied with [the results](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fjeremy.freehill.me).
