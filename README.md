Jeremy Freehill Portfolio Site
=========

Repository for my site. Anybody can view the source anyway, so why not make it easier?

hosted at: http://jeremy.freehill.me or http://jeremyfreehill.com

*Unrelated to this repo:* 
This page also acts as my testing ground for Google's [PageSpeed module for Apache](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module). The results can be seen in viewing the source as hosted on my server. Add `ModPagespeed=off` as a query string to the URL to see what it looks like prior to formatting.
